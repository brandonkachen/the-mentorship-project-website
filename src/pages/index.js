                  Our target audience for mentees are high schoolers who are
                  self-driven and are interested in building projects. Our
                  target audience for mentors are industry professionals who can
                  use their experience to guide mentees through their projects.

                  We match a mentee to a mentor who has skills in a field that
                  the mentee wishes to learn about. They then brainstorm a
                  project together, and the mentee spends the rest of the
                  program building it with guidance from their mentor. During
                  this time, they regularly meet with other mentor-mentee pairs
                  to discuss their progress and provide feedback and support to
                  one another. At the end of the program, the mentee gives a
                  presentation on their project to demonstrate their new
                  knowledge and skills gained through their mentorship.

                  Mentees learn hard skills related to the field theyâ€™re
                  learning about, improve soft skills like communication and
                  creativity, and grow their confidence in their own abilities
                  to complete difficult projects. Mentors experience selfless
                  joy from watching their mentees grow, reminisce about their
                  own highschool days, and feel a sense of giving back to the
                  next generation.
