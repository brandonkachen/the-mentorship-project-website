    <p class="subtitle">Good mentorship</p>
    <p class="content">
      Good mentorship is a positive sum game for all involved. At its core,
      mentors can see the potential in their mentees and push them to achieve
      it. Mentees, in turn, invoke a selfless joy in their mentees when they
      reach their goals. Both parties grow and bond through these interactions,
      which builds their relationship.

    <p class="subtitle">Personal Projects</p>
    <p class="content">
      Personal projects allow one to own a problem or idea they want to solve.
      As a result, they are more likely to feel motivated and creative when
      working on it. They are free to change it as they see fit, safe to fail
      and reiterate to improve it, and empowered to judge when it is done or
      good enough. Learning takes place easily in this environment.

    <p class="subtitle">Varied Interests</p>
    <p class="content">
      People aren't destined for only one career path. Everyone's career
      interests are varied based on their background, natural curiosity, etc.
      but it is uncommon for one to dabble and learn about them more. We believe
      it is valuable to learn about one's fields of interest, even if they do
      not pursue it professionally.
